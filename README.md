# Marketing-Analytics - RFM & CLV Analysis

In today's world, it is essential for companies to harness and levearge on data to formulate smart strategies which helps in retaining customers 
and improving their product satisfaction. Marketing analytics is a relatively new field that solves this problem for companies by offering 
meaningful insights into factors that help drive favorable outcomes from customer data.

This project applies 2 marketing analytics concepts; RFM and CLV to the customer base of an Australian bike company. The first part divides customers 
into different segements using the RFM framework. After segmentation is carried out, the CLV which reasonably predicts how much a company can expect 
from customers over the lifetime of their business relationship is then calculated. 

Data was sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahuljangam/bicycle-sales-australia and it shows 
transaction details, customer details and customer demographics.
