# Marketing-Analytics---RFM
RFM is an analytic framework used to understand and analyze customer behaviour based on three factors;

RECENCY - Last time the customer purchased from the business

FREQUENCY - How often does the customer patronize the business

MONETARY - Total spend of the customer during a particular period

RFM analysis enables businesses cluster their customer base into different homogenous segments so that they can engage with each group with different targeted marketing strategies. RFM segmentation also provides answers to frequently asked business questions like;

Who are my best customers?

Which customers are at the verge of churning?

Who are lost customers that you donâ€™t need to pay much attention to?

Who are your loyal customers?

Which customers you must retain?

Who has the potential to be converted into more profitable customers?

This project is focused on dividing the customer base of an Australian bike company into different segements using the RFM framework. Data was sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahuljangam/bicycle-sales-australia and it shows transaction details, customer details and customer demographics.
